Heavily inspired by Breeze Light theme and purposefully designed to match both [Evolvere Light Pure Circle Inverted Aurorae Theme][1] and [Breeze Light theme][2].

The theme has been thought with [Fira Sans Light][3] in mind -as seen in the screenshots section-. If you want that too, there is a commented bit at the start of user.css; uncomment it and you are good to go.
